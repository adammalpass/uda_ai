# uda_ai

Contains robotics projects taken as part of [Udacity's Artificial Intelligence for Robotics Course]. 

Main project is Runaway Robot, whereby a secondary robot is attempting to chase after an 'escaped' robot and using measurements from its sensors to try and track it down.

Also includes implementations of:

- SLAM (Simulataneous Localisation and Mapping)
- PID Controller

## Usage
All scripts can be run directly in Python2.7 and do not require any special additional packages to be installed.
